# School Management System (SMS)

## Project Overview

The School Management System (SMS) is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline administrative tasks, enhance communication, and support academic excellence within educational institutions. Developed with the needs of teachers, administrators, parents, and students in mind, SMS aims to optimize school operations and foster a conducive learning environment.

## Features

1. **User Management:** 
   - Administrators can manage user profiles for staff, students, and parents, ensuring accurate records and efficient communication.

2. **Class and Course Management:** 
   - Headteachers can manage class assignments, course offerings, and curriculum alignment, ensuring a cohesive academic program.

3. **Gradebook Management:** 
   - Teachers can record and track student grades, providing valuable feedback to support student progress and success.

4. **Attendance Tracking:** 
   - Teachers can monitor student attendance, identify patterns, and intervene proactively to support regular attendance and engagement.

5. **Announcement and Communication:** 
   - Administrators can post announcements and messages, keeping stakeholders informed about important events, deadlines, and updates.

6. **Parent Portal:** 
   - Parents can track their child's academic performance, receive notifications, and communicate with teachers to stay engaged in their child's education.

## Intended Use

SMS is intended for use by educational institutions, including schools, colleges, and universities, to streamline administrative processes and enhance communication within the school community. It is designed to support administrators, teachers, parents, and students in their respective roles, facilitating collaboration and promoting student success.

## Technologies and Algorithms

### Technologies

- **Backend:** Python, Django/Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript(jQuery)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **APIs:** RESTful APIs for communication between frontend and backend
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication
- **Environment Management:** Virtualenv for Python virtual environment
- **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes

### Algorithms

- **Authentication:** Secure hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) for password storage, JWT for token-based authentication
- **Data Validation:** Schema validation using libraries like Marshmallow or Django Rest Framework serializers
- **Attendance Tracking:** Algorithms to identify patterns and trends in attendance data
- **Grade Calculation:** Algorithms to calculate weighted averages and generate grade reports
- **Notification System:** Event-driven algorithms to trigger notifications based on specific actions (e.g., new grades posted, attendance alerts)

## Getting Started

To get started with SMS, follow these steps:

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Services

1. **Run the Main Service:**
   ```sh
   STORAGE_ENGINE=db STORAGE_USER=test_sms STORAGE_PASSWORD=test_sms_password STORAGE_DATABASE=sms_test_db STORAGE_HOST=localhost SMS_ENV=test python3 -m modules.service.v1.app
   ```

2. **Run the Authentication Service:**
   ```sh
   STORAGE_ENGINE=db STORAGE_USER=test_sms STORAGE_PASSWORD=test_sms_password STORAGE_DATABASE=sms_test_db STORAGE_HOST=localhost python3 -m modules.service.v1.microservices.authentication_service
   ```

### Frontend Setup

If your project includes a frontend component, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Frontend:**
   ```sh
   STORAGE_ENGINE=db STORAGE_USER=test_sms STORAGE_PASSWORD=test_sms_password STORAGE_DATABASE=sms_test_db STORAGE_HOST=localhost python3 -m web_dynamic.sms
   ```
